## Setup

To set up the dotfiles run this snippet in the terminal:
`bash -c "$(curl -LsS https://raw.github.com/spartDev/new-mac-setup/main/setup.sh)"`

The setup process will:

- Download the dotfiles on your computer
  (by default it will suggest `~/.dotfiles`).
- Create some additional directories.
- Symlink the Git, shell related files.
- Install applications / command-line tools for macOS.
- Set custom macOS preferences.
- Install VS Code plugins.
- Restart your computer.
